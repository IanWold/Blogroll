# Ian's Blogroll

This repository contains the code that generates my [blogroll](https://ian.wold.guru/Blogroll/), which is also hosted by GitHub Pages from this repository.

You can (and should) publish your own blogroll! Create a repo using [my StaticBlogroll template](https://github.com/IanWold/StaticBlogroll/) to get up and going!

This repo uses my static site generator [Metalsharp](https://github.com/IanWold/Metalsharp) to read a list of RSS links from a config and generate the static site. This build is run each day at midnight by GitHub Actions, keeping the latest posts up to date when I check it each morning.
